# Shinydex

Keep track of your shiny Pokémon collection by entering data about your hunts (for example your Pokémon's form and name, the game and method you used to hunt it, etc.).

See how close you are to completing your shiny Pokédex, and see what every shiny Pokémon looks like.

Share your collection with friends, and see their collections as well. You can also choose to appear in the public feed for everyone to see your progress!

- and more!
