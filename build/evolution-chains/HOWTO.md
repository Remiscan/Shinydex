- Get list of evolution chains by fetching https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/evolution-chain/?offset=0&limit=1000
- Get all evolution chains by fetching every URL returned by the first step
- Store these JSON files in the data subfolder here
- Run make-array.php
- Copy array.json to modified-evolutions-by-id.json
- Manually edit modified-evolutions-by-id.json to add form db-ids to the dex-ids when needed. For example:
	- `{"863": "52"}` becomes `{"863": "52-galar"}`
	- `{"80": "79"}` becomes `{"80": "79"}, {"80-galar": "79-galar"}`
- Build pokemon-data
- Go to https://localhost/shinydex/backend/test-sprites.php?catchable=1 and check for mistakes / incomplete evolution data
